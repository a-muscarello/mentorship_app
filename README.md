# **Mentorship App**
Created using Ruby 2.5.1

Final Group Project for the New York + Code Academy's inaugural cohort of the NYC Tech Talent Pipeline's Web Development Fellowship Program (June 2018).  Collaboration on this project by Ambika Muscarello, Danielle Danskin and Francis Agbodji.

Designing a mentorship matching app, that would allow mentors to provide their services to mentees for free.  At this time, this mentorship app will provide mentorship for technology areas such as Python, React, Node JS etc.  We foresee an expansion to other fields in the future.

### **MVP**
- Both mentors and mentees sign up for an account.
- A mentee can find a mentor/s and vice versa.
- A list of suitable mentors will be populated on the profile page based on the request selection at signup. 
- Once matched, either party can request to connect.
- If connection is accepted, a private chat room is created.
- The chat history will show in both their profile pages.
- Mentees have ability to like a mentor. 


### **Pivot** feature:
Users will have the ability to rank mentors.


### **Post** MVP
- More profile details and images/avatar.
- Geolocation for ease of in-person meet.
- Add more mentorship fields.
- Be able to provide reviews for good/exceptional mentors.
